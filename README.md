# Society Global Terrorism Data Analysis
# 📌 Overview
This project was completed as part of my data analyst internship at V Petrol as assesment round. The objective was to analyze and visualize global terrorism data from 1970 to 2015 to gain insights into attack patterns, targeted regions, and terrorist organizations. The project involved extensive data cleaning, exploration, and visualization to provide meaningful interpretations of terrorism trends worldwide.
I was selected for further rounds in the hiring process at V Petrol before being eliminated in the HR round. Despite this, the project stands as a strong demonstration of my data analysis skills, handling large datasets, and extracting key insights from complex information.

# 🔍 Key Features
* Data Preprocessing: Merging multiple datasets from different time periods (1970-2015) and handling missing values.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying trends in attack frequency, severity, and geographical distribution.
* Data Visualization: Using Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly to create impactful visual representations.
* Statistical Analysis: Examining correlations between attack types, locations, and terrorist groups.
* Geo-Visualization: Mapping terrorist incidents across the world using latitude and longitude data.

# 📂 Dataset Details
* Source: Global Terrorism Database (GTD)
* Timeframe: 1970 - 2015
* Size: 157,520 records, 137 features
* Features:
    * Date, location, and type of attacks
    * Perpetrator group names
    * Number of casualties (killed & wounded)
    * Target types (military, civilians, government, etc.)
    * Weapon types used
    * Attack success rate
# 🛠 Methodologies & Techniques
1. Data Cleaning & Processing:
    * Merging datasets from different years (1970-1991, 1992-2011, 2012-2015).
    * Handling missing values (e.g., replacing null values with appropriate indicators).
    * Dropping redundant or irrelevant features.
    * Sorting data chronologically.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    * Finding the most affected regions and countries.
    * Identifying peak years and months for terrorist activities.
    * Examining the most common attack methods (e.g., bombings, armed assaults).
    * Investigating targeted groups (e.g., civilians, military, government institutions).
3. Data Visualization:
    * Scatter Plots: Mapping terrorist attack locations.
    * Bar Charts: Year-wise casualties and attack frequencies.
    * Heatmaps: Regional intensity of terrorism.
    * Pie Charts: Distribution of attack types and targeted groups.
    * Stacked Bar Charts: Yearly variations in attack types.
4. Statistical Analysis:
    * Evaluating attack frequency trends.
    * Correlating attack types with location and target.
    * Analyzing perpetrator uncertainty levels.
      
# 📊 Insights & Findings
1. Peak Years for Terrorism:
    * The worst years were 2014, 2015, 2013, 2012, and 2007, with a significant spike in incidents.
2. Most Targeted Regions:
    * Middle East & North Africa, South Asia, and Western Europe faced the highest number of attacks.
3. Countries with Most Attacks:
    * Iraq, Pakistan, and India ranked as the top three most affected countries.
4. Preferred Attack Methods:
    * Bombings/Explosions were the most commonly used tactics, followed by armed assaults and assassinations.
5. Most Targeted Groups:
    * Civilians, military personnel, and government officials were the primary targets.
6. Active Terrorist Groups:
    * The most active groups included Taliban, ISIL, and the Shining Path (SL).
7. Weapon Analysis:
    * Unknown explosive types were frequently used, along with automatic weapons and projectiles.
